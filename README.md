# redditanalytic
The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern, Tomcat/Netbeans, and JSP are being used in this reddit analytic project.

This project makes use of the Reddit API, Create, Update and Delete(CRUD):

- Retrieve e-mail addresses and data posts/comments

- Look for subreddits with specific "word" tags.

- Allow users to post comments on various subreddits directly
